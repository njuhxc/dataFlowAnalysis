ECMAScript Pointer Analysis
===========================

This is a simple Andersen-style pointer analysis for JavaScript, itself implemented in JavaScript.

Installation
------------

Run `npm install` in this directory to pull in dependencies.


Overview
--------

The main analysis is implemented in `analysis.js`, which uses the solver in `solver.js`. The solver, in turn, relies on `absvars.js` and `absvals.js` for managing abstract variables and values, respectively. The standard library model is in `stdlib_model.js`; the DOM model in `dom_model.js` is generated by running `idl2js.js` on the WebIDL specifications in directory `idl`.
